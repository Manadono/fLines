The goal of this set of CLIs is to provide a quick and easy way to use FFMPEG remuxing without having to spend hours reading the manual.

All video going into the mux must be at the same frame rate, and in the same format.
This is designed to be used post Handbrake to save time re-reencoding video (which sucks by the way)

All audio going in has to be something but I can't remember what, iirc it won't allow MP3, but prove me wrong. WAV and AAC are recommended.

I have an audio stream replacer CLI (I actually have 2) but I can't remember which one does what so I am not including them as of 18/9.


enjoy concatenating your dropped streams :)
